// == About me
+++<img src="{static}/images/tg-202005.jpg" width="160" height="160" align="right" />+++
My name is https://isi.edu/~tg/[Thamme Gowda], aka 'TG'.
I am doing a bunch of tasks now, maybe you want to know me as one of these:

* I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at USC Viterbi School of Engineering.
My graduate adviser is https://www.isi.edu/~jonmay/[Prof. Jonathan May^].
* I work as a research programmer at USC ISI. I build and deliver machine translation models (a few DARPA/IARPA projects).
* I am the current organizer of https://nlg.isi.edu/nl-seminar/[Natural Language Seminar^] series at USC ISI.

_Research interests:_ I am currently trying to finish up my dissertation focusing on rare phenomena learning in (neural) machine translation.
Here is my _work-in-progress_ +++<a href="{static}/files/TG-CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> <small>(I need to update this!)</small>+++

== More ?

I speak Kannada/ಕನ್ನಡ, Telugu/తెలుగు, and Hindi/हिन्दी ( +English, of course!).
I was raised by a family of farmers in a southern Indian village.
So, beside the "professional" experience that I have displayed here, I also have much more experience in agriculture that you will not hear: vineyard, silkworms, dairy, sheep, poultry ...!

I came to this grad school for learning the artificial intelligence, but I also ended up learning a bit about myself/consciousness:

____
While coding an artificial soul for machines +
He wins his gifts, defeats his curses +
And discovers his own soul that thinks and feels!

[quote, "The Great Sayings of the Upanishads; BCE"]
____
Consciousness is divine [Prajnanam Brahman] +
This self/spirit/Atma is divine [Ayam Atma Brahman] +
You're that [Tat Vam Asi] +
I'm it [Aham Brahmasmi]
