// == About me

My name is Thamme Gowda. I am often known by my shorthand name 'TG'.
I am working as a research programmer in the USC ISI Natural Language Processing Group
while pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science at USC Viterbi School of Engineering.
My graduate adviser is https://www.isi.edu/~jonmay/[Dr. Jonathan May^].

My current research is focused on neural machine translation (NMT),
and broadly natural language processing (NLP) technologies. More concretely,

* Machine learning with focus on NLP applications
* Natural language understanding and generation e.g. machine translation
* Dealing with the curses of natural imbalances
** e.g. consequences of Zipfian distribution on machine learning models and evaluations

// Summary of in more abstract way: study of function approximators for temporal sequences, their weaknesses, and solutions to their weaknesses.

I came to grad school for learning artificial intelligence but ended up learning a bit about myself/consciousness instead:

____
While coding an artificial soul for machines +
He wins his gifts, defeats his curses +
And, discovers his own soul that thinks and feels!
____

[quote, "The Great Sayings of the Upanishads; BCE"]
____
Consciousness is divine [Prajnanam Brahma] +
This self/spirit/Atma is divine [Ayam Atma Brahma] +
You're that [Tat Vam Asi] +
I'm it [Aham Brahmasmi]
