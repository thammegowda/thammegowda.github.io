My name is https://isi.edu/~tg/[Thamme Gowda], aka 'TG'.
I am pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science at USC Viterbi School of Engineering. My graduate adviser is https://www.isi.edu/~jonmay/[Prof. Jonathan May^].
I am a research programmer (full-time) at USC ISI; I build and deliver state-of-the-art machine translation models.

I am a current organizer of https://nlg.isi.edu/nl-seminar/[Natural Language Seminar] series at USC ISI, which is held weekly on Thursdays 11:00am - 12:00 noon.

* Machine learning with a focus on NLP applications.
* Dealing with the curses of natural imbalances
** e.g. consequences of Zipfian distribution on machine learning models and their evaluations.

== More ?

I speak Kannada, Telugu, and Hindi ( +English, of course!). I was raised by a family of farmers in a southern Indian village. So beside the "professional" experience that I have displayed in this site, I also have much more experience in agriculture that you will not hear: vineyard, silkworms, dairy, sheep, poultry ...!

I came to this grad school for learning artificial intelligence, but instead ended up learning a bit about myself/consciousness:

He wins his gifts, defeats his curses +
And discovers his own soul that thinks and feels!

Consciousness is divine [Prajnanam Brahman] +
This self/spirit/Atma is divine [Ayam Atma Brahman] +
You're that [Tat Vam Asi] +
I'm it [Aham Brahmasmi]
