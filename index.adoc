About Me:

image:imgs/tg-202005.jpg[TG, 160, 160, float="left"]
My name is Thamme Gowda. I am often known by shorthand name 'TG'.
I am working as a research programmer in the USC ISI Natural Language Processing Group
while pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science at USC Viterbi School of Engineering.
My graduate adviser is https://www.isi.edu/~jonmay/[Dr. Jonathan May].

My current research is focused on neural machine translation (NMT),
and broadly natural language processing (NLP) technologies.
