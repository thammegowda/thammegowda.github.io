== About me
image:imgs/tg-202005.jpg[TG, 160, 160, float="left"]
My name is Thamme Gowda. I am often known by my shorthand name 'TG'.
I am working as a research programmer in the USC ISI Natural Language Processing Group
while pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science at USC Viterbi School of Engineering.
My graduate adviser is https://www.isi.edu/~jonmay/[Dr. Jonathan May^].


My current research is focused on neural machine translation (NMT),
and broadly natural language processing (NLP) technologies. More concretely,

* Machine learning with focus on NLP applications
* Natural language understanding and generation e.g. machine translation
* Dealing with the curses of natural imbalances
** e.g. consequences of Zipfian distribution on machine learning models and evaluations

My research summarized in more abstract way: study of function approximators for temporal sequences, their weaknesses, and solutions to their weaknesses.

Or, with a touch of poetry and spirituality:
[quote, "'self' reflection on my research; 2020"]
____
While coding an artificial soul for machines +
He wins his gifts, defeats his curses +
And, discovers his own soul that thinks and feels!

== Software Engineering

Solving problems using math and computers is my favourite job to do.
I hope my work help make this world a better place!
I emphasize on good software engineering practices, and open sourcing of software with permissible license.
In the beginning (2012-2015) I wrote a lot of code in Java/Groovy/Scala, but recent years (2015-Now), Python has become my go to choice, and I  have released a bunch of tools to https://pypi.org/user/Thamme.Gowda/[PyPi^].
I also participate in https://stackoverflow.com/users/1506477/thamme-gowda[StackOverflow QA threads^].
